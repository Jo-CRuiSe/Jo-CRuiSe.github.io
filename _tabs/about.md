### Hi there 👋, I'm Jo Crusie!

- 🏫 A student majoring in electronic science and technology at Shanghai Jiao Tong University.
- 💻 I'm currently engaged in studies of C++, Swift, Python, AppleScript, Markdown, HTML and CSS.
- 🎨 I have a profound interest in fields related to the arts.
- 🌟 I have an immense enthusiasm for learning and exploring new things.

**For the sake of time, I have to suspend my blog construction. I'll do that right after my main works done.**

What I'm going to do:

- Connect to Baidu/Bing/Google search engine.
- Perfect the decoration of mail notification for comments.
- Perfect the 'about' page.
